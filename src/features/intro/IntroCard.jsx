        I'm a software engineer and a cat lover who is from the world of art, beauty, and music. I like to think of myself as someone who bridges creativity with technology. I would like to use my skills to make the comunity and world a better place.

      With a sharp eye for detail and a natural curiosity, I’m always looking for ways to improve things. I thrive on solving problems, and if I spot an open seam, I’m eager to stitch it up. Programming, to me, is like a conversation with the computer—write the right message, get the right response, and together we can innovate.

      Before I became a software engineer, I was a Japanese teacher, and my love for language still runs deep. I’m fascinated by the magic of communication, whether it’s through spoken words or lines of code. And as a lifelong learner, I’m always exploring new things—there’s always more to discover!
